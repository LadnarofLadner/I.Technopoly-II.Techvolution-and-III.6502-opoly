# I.Technopoly-II.Techvolution-and-III.6502-opoly
# 3 monopoly type board games; one quite boring, one teaching computer history, and one teaching assembly language 6502 programming.

#OK First git-hub ever. So I'll just kind of wing it.

#Many of these ideas exist elsewhere on the net but are inextricably intertwined with a hundred other ideas I've had, making this distillation something of a necessity.
#Hopefully can be made a bored/board game IRL (AFK).

#Game 1 : Technopoly. Exactly like monopoly, only each real estate property is actually an intellectual property (IP). The rules for play are identical. I haven't really thought up what to use for houses or hotels. I figure maybe tokens indicating improvements to the tech. 4 small improvement tokens + cash trade in for a paradigm shift "hotel". Something like that.

#Game 2 : Techvolution . Significant rule change. Each real estate property is actually an "IP timeline", of 16 properties. This means, for each of the 22 colored real estate properties of regular monopoly, there are actually 16 possible Intellectual Properties (IPs) available. They must be bought in chronological and/or complexity order, as established by the numbering system indicated by the game. There 16 eras or ages that govern the pace of the game and the opening of Intellectual Properties that are available for purchase.
# For instance, the game begins in prehistory and only prehistoric technologies can be bought. After a (presently unspecified) number of circuits around the board, the age will advance to iron/stone/bronze age and new IPs become available. This upsets any equilibrium hithertofore established. Because you no longer monopolize the tech you possess. If somebody lands on your IP they pay you the rent, but then have first option to buy the newly available tech. If they pay only rent and pass up purchase, it goes up for bid among remaining players, as in a standard monopoly-type game.

# Perhaps this is the first "commit" or "pull request"? Does anybody wish to do some statistics for me? I have a "random rolls" python ( pygame) script ( that I have "borrowed" from a professor or a YouTube video) and with a small extension, perhaps, someone could find, for players 2,3,4,5,6,7 or 8, how many rolls, on average, are required to cover all the "color" squares, at least once. It is my intention that the lagging player (fewest number of circuits) will set the pace. So, to restate the question, precisely and succinctly, for a variable number of players, what is the ideal minimum number of circuits for the lagging player before the age should shift from prehistory to iron age, thus opening up new IPs?

#Game 3 : 6502-opoly. The center of the board no longer functions as that space that people argue over when they try to put money in the center and try take it out when they land on free parking. Now it will be a schematic of that wonderfully revolutionary processor, the 6502. The registers X, Y, S, and PCH and PCL, will be pocket folders (in the physically instantiation of the game). They will fit "Op-Code cards" and data cards (just slips of paper? With 1s and 0s?) And perhaps in conjunction with Game 1 or Game 2, or perhaps not during gameplay but at the end of the regular game, a person could add to their score by hand coding the fanciest program? I dunno. I'll have to make up a RAM/ROM/IO/Stack card for everybody to use. Again, the RAM card, in the physical instantiation  of the board game, will just be a bunch of addressed paper pockets from which the center board CPU can fetch data and op codes.


#If you are interested in other work done up to this point , please see the 6502 forum and the tiny core (picore; raspberyy pi) forum. I posted under several names there. ladnar. dranonymous2000. randallmeyer2000. I think? It's getting hard to be someone? But it all works out? I have too many pseudonyms.

#OK I have no time to proofread or do any of that licencing crap here, so just assume its free if you want to help out. Copyleft. GNU GPL 2.0 or whatever the heck. If you do take and make, you may reference me as Randall Meyer, or Ladnar of Ladner, but I suppose I prefer both. Take it. Have fun. Code it better than I can. Use all the graphics that I personally adapted--sometimes bit by literal bit, pixel by pixel, in a bitmap file in MS paintbrush--from a monopoly board. But do recall Lizzie Maggie owned it first. It took 70 or 100 years for Parker's Brothers to steal it and simplify it and sue people for ownership. By returning the game to its original profundity we can undermine the latter day prophets of monetary fundamentalism.

#I envisioned three instantiations of the "3-Game" game.

#First. Physical.

#Second Python ( pygames)

#Third Andoid App ( I started in Java , but smart people might want to use Kotlin)
