# I.Technopoly-II.Techvolution-and-III.6502-opoly
# 3 monopoly type board games; one quite boring, one teaching computer history, and one teaching assembly language 6502 programming.

#OK First git-hub ever. So I'll just kind of wing it.

#Many of these ideas exist elsewhere on the net but are inextricably intertwined with a hundred other ideas I've had so this distillation is probably necessary.
#Hopefully can be made a bored/board game IRL (AFK).

#Game 1 : Technopoly. Exactly like monopoly, only each real estate property is actually an intellectual property. The rules for play are identical. I haven't really thought up what yo use for houses or hotels. I figure maybe tokens indicating improvements to the tech. 4 small improvement tokens + cash trade in for a paradigm shift "horel". Soneyhing like that.

#Game 2 : Techvolution . Significant rule change. Each real estate property is actually an "IP timeline", of 16 properties. This neams, for each of the 22 colored real estate properties of regular monopoly, there are actually 16 possible Intelkectual Properties available. They must be bought in chronological and/or complexity order, as established by the numbering system indicated by the game. There 16 eras or ages that govern the pace of the game abd the opening if Ibtwlkectual Properties that are available for purchase.
# For unstabxe, the game begins in prehistory and only prehistoric technologies can be bought. After a presently unspecified number of circuits around the board, the age will advance ti irob/stibe/bronze age and new Ups become available. This upsets any equilibrium which has occurred. Because you no longer monopolize the tech you possess. If somebody kands in your IP they pay you the rent but have first option to buy the new tech. If the pay only rent and pass up purchase, it goes up for his aming remaining players, as in regular monopoly.

# perhaps this is the first "committ"? Does anybody wish to do some statistics for me? I have a "random rolls" python ( pygame) script ( that I have "borrowed" from a professor or a YouTube video) and with a small extension, perhaps, someone could fibd, for players 2,3,4,5,6,7 or 8, how many rolls, on average, are required to cover all the "color" squares, at least once. It is my intention that the lagging player ( fewest number of circuits) will set the pace. So, to restate, for a variable numver of players, what us the ideal minimum circuits for the lagging player before the age should shismdt forum prehistory to iron age, thus opening new IP?

#Game 3 : 6502-opoly. The center ifcthe board, no longer relegated to that space people argue over when they try to put money in the center and take it when they landcon free parking. Now it will be aschenatic of that wonderful revolutionary processor, the 6502. The registers XYS and PCH and PCL will be pocket folders. They will fit "Op-Code cards" and data cards ( just slips of paper? With 1s and 0s?) And perhaps in conjunction with Game 1 or Game 2, or perhaps not during gameplay bit at the end of the?regular game, a person could add to their score by hand coding the fanciest program? I dunno. I'll have to make up a RAM/ROM/IO/Stack card for everybody to use. Again. Just?a card with a bunch of pockets from which the center board CPU can fetch data and op codes.


#If you are interested in other work done up to this point , please seer the 6502 forum and the tiny core forum. I posted under several names there. ladnar. dranonymous2000. randallmeyer2000. I think? It's getting hard to be someone? But it all works out? I have too many pseudonyms.

#OK I have no time to proofread or do any of that licencing crap here, so just assume it a free if you want to help out. Copyleft. GNU GPL 2.0 or whatever the heck. If you do take and nake, you may reference me as Randall Meuer, or Ladnar if Ladner, but I suppose I prefer both. Take it. Have fun. Code it better than I can. Use all the graphics that I personally adapted, some times bit by bit in a bitmap file in MS oaintbrush, from a monopoly board. But do recall Lizzie Maggie owned it first. It took 70 or 100 years for Parker's brothers to steal it and simplify it and sue people for ownership. By returning the game to its original profundity we can undermine the latter day prophets of monetrary fundamentalism.

#I envisioned 3 instantiation if the "3-game" Game.

#First. Physical.

#Second Python ( pygames)

#Third Andoid App ( I started in Java , but smart people might want to use Koine)
